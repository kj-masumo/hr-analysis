## Intro
This was a data science and analysis project that was designed to help Abt Associates, a global technology consulting firm, improve their hiring and talent retention, with a specific focus on diversity. This project was open-ended, and our team was given access to a variety of internal files and was encouraged to present on anything we discovered that we felt was useful. At the end of the project, we presented our findings to company management. I worked on this project with Varsha Gururaj, Aimee Oliver, Salim Shaikh, and Amol Soley.

## Methodology
The first phase of this project involved familiarizing ourselves with the data made available to us. After we were more comfortable with the data, we developed a protocol to determine if the company was meeting certain thresholds in the results of their hiring practices. Finally, we developed a set of recommendations for company management to meet their desired goals. The protocol used to determine the thresholds of success and the set of recommendations were heavily influenced by extensive domain research and competitive analyses to ensure that they were realistic and in line with other companies in industry.
